<p>In 2019 I was part of the project group that puts together an annual LAN-party for students, aimed especially at computing science/interaction and design students. The LAN-party this year took place during a weekend in November and I helped with planning tournaments, contacting sponsors, and setting up the venue etc. I introduced a new tournament in Overcooked 2 which was really appreciated. Around a 100 students attended the event which we consider a great success! </p>
