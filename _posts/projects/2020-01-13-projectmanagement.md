<p>For a project management course me and a couple of other students put together a short film with the purpose of attracting new students to the STEM field. This was a fun project as I have always been interested in video production and so I took the chance to edit the film on my own to learn Premiere Pro a bit better. Overall it wasn't the most serious and ambitious of projects, but it sure was exciting to interview people around campus and get to know my new camera more. </p>
