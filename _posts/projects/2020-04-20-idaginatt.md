<p>In 2019/2020 I was part of the project group that puts together an annual event day for the Interaction & Design program in Ume√•. Me and a friend had responsibility for the website of the event and being my first web project, this taught me a lot about HTML, CSS and Javascript.
Because of Covid-19 however, the project was not finished by us and the event was postponed. </p>
