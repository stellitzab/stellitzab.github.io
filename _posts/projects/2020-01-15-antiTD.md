<p>Around christmas of 2019, me and three other students created our own game according to a specification given in a course. This game was an anti-tower defence game, meaning that the computer generated the towers and the player would put out the troups. The theme we had was that christmas presents (the troups) were to be delivered to the children, but had to first escape the evil post service (the towers). A lot of time was spent planning the project and designing the system using UML. We used the XML format to store levels and this was part of my main focus during the project, to both create levels, parse and validate the data. This project was fun and we learnt a lot about team work and I am especially pleased to have been a part of the finished product.</p>
