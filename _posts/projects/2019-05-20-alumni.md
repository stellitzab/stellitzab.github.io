<p>In the spring of 2019 we were tasked with designing a new platform for Ume√• University alumni. Together in a group of 4 other students, we did everything from researching what alumni could possibly want from such a system and how they currently connected with each other, to brainstorming and sketching on new ideas. I was mainly responsible for sketching prototypes in Adobe XD in this project, and took it as a great opportunity to learn the Adobe suite better. At the end we delivered a presentation consisting of a prototype and a finished concept for this new alumni network page.</p>
