description: "Moved from my home town Luleå when I was 21 to go study human-computer-interaction/design/coding at the Umeå University. Best decision of my life! Currently balancing a rather heavy workload in school with all the fun stuff I enjoy like video games, dinner nights with friends and spending time outdoors."
mission: "Recently started my own business primarily to do some front-end web development work during the summer of 2020."
